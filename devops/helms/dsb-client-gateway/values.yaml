      # -- The URL of the DSB Message Broker you want to connect to. Trailing / allowed.
      dsb_base_url: http://dsb-demo.energyweb.org
      # -- This allows the DSB Message Broker to be controlled by the DSB Client Gateway. In this situation, the identities of both components are shared. This means that a single private key is used for each component and, in addition to the user DSB role, the gateway will enrol itself as a messagebroker. If a DSB_CONTROL_TYPE is also provided, the gateway may spawn a process with the chosen method, in order to configure it (i.e. setting the same private key).
